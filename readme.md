Your provided script successfully combines audio extraction, transcription, and SRT file segmentation with timestamp splitting. Below is a detailed explanation of its functionality and improvements to make it more streamlined and error-free:

### Key Features of the Script:
1. **Audio Extraction from Video:**
   - Uses FFmpeg to extract audio from video files.
   - Saves audio as a 16kHz mono WAV file suitable for transcription.

2. **Audio Transcription with Whisper:**
   - Utilizes OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe audio into text.
   - Outputs a raw transcription and converts it to SRT format with proper timestamps.

3. **Timestamp Formatting:**
   - Formats timestamps to the SRT standard (`HH:MM:SS,ms`).
   - Splits subtitle segments that exceed the specified maximum duration (e.g., 3 seconds).

4. **SRT Parsing and Processing:**
   - Reads existing SRT files.
   - Splits segments into smaller chunks while maintaining synchronization and logical text distribution.

### Recommended Improvements:
1. **Error Handling for File Selection:**
   - Ensure the script gracefully handles cases where no file is selected or input files are missing.

2. **Ensure Consistent Time Conversion:**
   - Adjust timestamp parsing and splitting to handle edge cases like overlapping segments.

3. **Dynamic User Input:**
   - Allow the user to set parameters like `max_duration` and output file names via command-line arguments or prompts.

4. **Cleanup Temporary Files:**
   - Remove intermediate audio files after processing to save disk space.

### Suggested Usage:

1. **Run the script: To convert video to Transcript** 
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   

2. **Select your video file** through the file dialog.
3. **Select the Trascripted File and Reduce the file size Run**
```bash
   python srt.py
   ```

4. **Enter the maximum segment duration** when prompted (default is 3.0 seconds).

5. **Check the output:**
   - Extracted audio saved as `output_audio.wav`.
   - Transcribed subtitles saved as `transcription.srt`.
   - Reduced subtitles saved as `reduced_timestamps.srt`.

### Todo list:
- [ ] **GUI Integration:** Add a simple GUI using `tkinter` to manage input and output files.

- [ ]  **Multilingual Support:** Configure Whisper to transcribe in specific languages if needed.

- [ ] **Testing Framework:** Use test SRT files to validate all edge cases.
